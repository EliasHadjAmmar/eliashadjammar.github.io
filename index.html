        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p>I am currently a mathematics student at Lund University. I recently completed my B.Sc. in Economics 
          from LMU Munich with a final grade of 1,12 (equivalent to 3.9 GPA). In addition to economics, about a third of 
          my coursework consisted of statistics, econometrics, machine learning, business, and databases.</p>

        <p>I worked as a research assistant at LMUâ€™s Department of Economics for more than a year. Among other things, I 
          contributed to a code pipeline for the automatic digitisation of archival data in Python, and implemented 
          statistical measures of residential segregation in R.</p>

        <p>My CV will be found here shortly.</p>
